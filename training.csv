"I (27M) have been struggling with acne or skin problems in general, for about 14 years and its getting kind of annoying. With this post, i would hope i can get an answer to what is wrong with my skin. Initially i had a lot of cystic acne when my skin problems started, which is why i have a lot of scars. However, after i graduated my masters in an engineering discipline, the stress levels calmed down a lot. This helped a lot with my cystic acne, but i still get them time to time, and i do get some annoying pimples here and there. The last 3 years i have started struggling with dandruff in my face, as you can see in the pictures. This has been a real confidence booster for me lately, and i would like to do something about it. I'm from Norway, and the dandruff problem gets worse in the winter, which i suppose is because of the cold and dry weather.	Dry	"

"I literally have to exfoliate every single day to get rid of this awful, gritty, bumpy, dry skin that builds up no matter how much I moisturize. It’s not eczema, it’s not keratosis pilaris, it’s not psoriasis. It’s just this awful bumpy bits of dry skin that builds up all over my face EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. I am at my wits end with my stupid skin, and no moisturizers I’ve tried have done anything unless I apply it three times a day. Even then it barely helps. I’d really appreciate some help!	Dry	"
"I have had dry skin my entire life, and it just gets worse and worse. My face has always been dry and patchy, and will flake off even though I cleanse and moisturize daily with a gentle cleanser and use a gentle moisturizer- I’ve been using Aveeno cleanser and Aveeno oat gel moisturizer. I drink a ton of water and it gets only minimally better. I have tried so many different moisturizers, but many of them burn my skin, or they create a super oily feeling that’s awful. I recently have been working out more often, but every time, my sweat burns like an allergic reaction and I have bright red patchy spots on my cheeks. My normal moisturizer that usually doesn’t bother me, now burns severely. Even yawning makes my face hurt like it’s cracking. How can I fix my poor, dry face?	Dry	"

For a long time I thought my skin was too dry for acids, but in college I discovered that glycolic acid worked wonders for me. My running hypothesis was that my flaky dead skin didn’t slough off well and would then clog my pores, causing acne. The acid helped resurface everything, hence the reduced flakiness and general improvement.	Dry	"

"Oily skin (seborrhea) is a common cosmetic problem that occurs when oversized sebaceous glands produce excessive amounts of sebum giving the appearance of shiny and greasy skin.

The deeper understanding of this skin type provides the opportunity to better guide patients regarding skin care and also assist in the development of sebosuppressive agents.	Oily	"
